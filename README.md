## **ABOUT**

This is a project that I will be working on while learning the fundamental stuff of the Flutter framework. Everything is self-learned here (for the moment I'm writing this doc at least), so if you think something's a bit off please inform me via [minhtrang072121@gmail.com](mailto:minhtrang072121@gmail.com).


## **INSTALLATION**

```
git clone https://github.com/beckachuu/I-prefer-not-to-name-this-right-now.git

cd I-prefer-not-to-name-this-right-now
```
Then click the "Run" button of the void main() in [main.dart](lib/main.dart) (remind me to rewrite this installation guide someday...)

## **FEATURES**
- Implemented:
    - Software architecture: Clean architecture (Feature-first)
    - Converting JSON string to an equivalent dart object and vice versa with json serializable

- Todo:
    - State management solution: Cubit (Why? As far as I know, it's more lightweight than Bloc and can handle more comlex state management than GetX)
    - Performing CRUD operation using Dio and go rest api
    - Implementing Interceptors, Global configuration and timeout for api calls
    - Exception Handling with Dio interceptor, Dartz and freezed
    - Dependency injection with get it
    - Displaying error type to the user through the alert dialogs

**This features list (and the project architecture) (and most of my starter code...) is referenced from https://github.com/SinaSys/flutter_go_rest_app**
